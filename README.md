Default Boilerplate for Standalone CMS Project

##  Quick start

1.  **Clone git repository**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to clone the existing repo to your local machine, namely, the default starter.

    ```shell
    # clone an existing repository
    git clone https://github.com/(username)/(repository-name)
    ```

2.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start a local development environment.

    ```shell
    cd (cloned-folder)
    gatsby develop
    ```

3.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the cloned directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time.

4.  **Add/Commit/Push changes to local files**

    When you are finished, be sure to stage, commit, then push local changes to the master/branch.

    ```shell
    git add .
    git commit -m "some message/comment here"
    git push -u origin master/branch
    ```
